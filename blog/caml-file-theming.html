    <h1>Theming iOS Control Center modules on iOS 11 and above with CAML</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In iOS 11, Apple totally revamped the Control Center to become more modular and clean. Ever since then, it was
      thought that theming the icon modules were almost impossible, as they were written in a weird file format: CAML.
      Workarounds for this through jailbreak tweaks were made by creating entirely separate icon modules that contained
      just static pngs (flipswitch/flipconvert). This is fine, but the only exception to this are the sliders. It was
      mostly thought to be impossible to theme those by the theming community until now.</p>
    <h2>Wtf is CAML?</h2>
    <p>Huge thanks to iOSCreatix for his medium post. Read this article if you want to understand more. His maize
      repository on Github (<a
        href="https://github.com/andrewwiik/Maize/tree/master/Modules">https://github.com/andrewwiik/Maize/tree/master/Modules</a>)
      also contains many examples of CAML files that I used to understand it.</p>
    <p>Essentially, CAML is a xml kind of file that describes how a particular CC module is drawn, and uses
      CoreGraphics/CoreAnimation. Although the API for CAML is private, CoreAnimation documentation is public on Apple’s
      website here: <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Using CAML to theme icons?</h2>
    <p>Some icons use assets from the <a href="http://Assets.car"><code>Assets.car</code></a> in their directory, but
      most animated icons use CAShapeLayers. The most interesting property of this is <code>path</code>, which is a
      CGPath. CGPaths are something similar to SVGs, so they can be scaled up or down without losing quality. There are
      two ways of theming this, one of which i’ve tried and failed: Replacing CAShapeLayer with a regular CALayer and
      adding a normal PNG, or converting your image into a CGPath that can be drawn.</p>
    <h2>Using normal images</h2>
    <p><a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410773-contents">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410773-contents</a>
    </p>
    <p>CALayer has a property <contents> that accepts an image and places it on the CC slider. It would have been
        perfect for my use case until I tried it and… it looked horrible.</p>
    <p>&#x200B;</p>
    <div class="centered"><img src="../img/img5.webp"></img></div>
    <p>This isn’t an issue if you’re using a solid 1square png or something. But most of the time you aren’t, which
      brings me to the second method:</p>
    <h2>Converting images to CGPaths</h2>
    <p>If you look at the medium post from above, you may have seen something interesting in the CAShapeLayer:</p>
    <img src="../img/img4.webp"></img>
    <p>The <code>path</code> property draws an image on the layer using CGPath. Sounds similar to SVGs. How do you
      convert a PNG to something that can be converted to CGPath? Well firstly, you’d need to convert it to a SVG image
      first. Use <a href="https://photopea.com">https://photopea.com</a> to do so. Find an app (Paintcode) or (<a
        href="http://svg-converter.kyome.io/">http://svg-converter.kyome.io/</a>) that converts SVG images into
      UIBezierPaths for Apple. These have a property that prints the CGPath of the image:</p>
    <div class="centered"><img src="../img/img3.webp"></img></div>
    <p>I couldn’t figure out how to do this with normal swift without creating an xcode app project. I’m not a swift dev
      :sadge:. Paste the UIBezierPath code generated by your app, remove context, then print the path’s
      <code>.cgPath</code> to find the string needed to draw your desired image. Note that you may need multiple
      CAShapeLayers if you want different opacities for different parts of the image. Now, you can copy any image that
      you’d like and convert it into a CC module. Pretty cool. But there’s obviously more to this than just having a
      static image on your sliders. How they are animated is by using LKState/CAState. I still do not fully understand
      them, but the Medium post i linked above does a fairly good job at explaining them.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <div class="contentflexboxleft">
      <div class="contentleft">
        <img src="../img/img1.webp"></img>
      </div>
      <div class="contentright">
        <img src="../img/img2.webp"></img>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>I hope that this post has brought more insight to the CAML format and how they can be used by you to theme any
      Control Center module with a jailbreak/MacDirtyCow (MDC probably won’t work with animations, as the modified file
      needs to be smaller or the same size as the original).</p>
