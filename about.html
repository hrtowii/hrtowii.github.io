        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>I'm Lucas, a Y1 student in NYP.</p>
            <p>If I were to describe myself in a few words, they would be:</p>
        <u><h3>Bookworm</h3></u>
        <u><h3>Tech-savvy</h3></u>
        <u><h3>Leader</h3></u>

        <h1>Self-Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Bookworm</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I love to read a variety of both fiction and non-fiction books, as it offers a wide range of perspectives for me to contemplate and think. Reading allows me to dive into worlds and live many lives. George R.R Martin once said: &quot;A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies.&quot; and I wholeheartedly agree.</p>
        <h2>Leader</h2>    
            <p>I was honored to become the chairperson of my school&#39;s Library Club, and cherished every moment that I had together with my CCA mates. It was something that brought solace to me. Knowing that what I did could bring the same joy that I had when reading to others, was enough for me.</p>
        <h2>Tech-savvy</h2>
            <p>Whenever I&#39;m bored at home, I will naturally gravitate towards tinkering with my electronic devices. After being inspired by learning Scratch in Primary School, I continued to learn basic Python coding during my free time. This year, I&#39;ve just learnt about iOS app development using Swift, and have also been learning some basic courses in that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, what would I want to achieve with my Information Technology diploma? Besides knowing more about coding, I want to be able to make people&#39;s lives more convenient through coding. Life now is all interconnected through the internet; banking is done online, movies can be streamed online, and even dating can be done online. I hope that by joining this course, I&#39;m able to make a positive impact on the world by developing useful tools for people to use.</p>
