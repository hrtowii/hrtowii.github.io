                    <p>When I was in primary school, I was introduced to using Scratch for programming simple games.
                        This is one of them. </p>

                <ul>
                    <p>I was introduced to jailbreaking my iPhone by my friend. Jailbreaking is the process of achieving
                        root access to one's iPhone. </p>
                    <p>As jailbreaking is extremely powerful, it also allows one to inject code into iOS, more
                        colloquially known as "tweaks". </p>
                    <p>This piqued my interest, and I've hence written my own tweak that allows folders to be nested.

                <ul>
                    <p>Through my school's Applied Learning Programme, I learnt to use mBot and Arduino and how to
                        programme a robot to complete basic obstacle courses. </p>
                    <p>I coded the mBot to only follow black colored lines, and to turn automatically whenever it
                        detected a wall. </p>

                <ul>
                    <p>I've always been intrigued by apps, and how they're coded for so many devices while maintaining
                        user friendliness. </p>
                    <p>Recently, since the Covid-19 Pandemic started, more and more apps have been released to aid
                        people fare through tough times during lockdown by providing various goods/services (eg.
                        Redmart, Carousell) </p>
                    <p>Hence, I started to search up on what languages mobile apps are coded in, and came across Swift.
                        Swift is the native language used in Apple iPhone applications. </p>
                    <p>I've since learnt some basic Swift from Codecademy and am currently learning SwiftUI through "100
                        Days of Swift(UI)" by Hacking with Swift. </p>

                <ul>
                    <p>Recently, I started to learn more in depth about programming, and have learnt more about classes,
                        objects and inheritance. </p>
                    <p>To test my knowledge, I've created a program that acts as a periodic table. You can add and
                        remove elements, and can view an element by entering either its name, symbol, proton number, or
                        atomic number. </p>

                    <p>Coding a website for my portfolio seemed like a fun challenge and project, as I have never used
                        HTML or CSS ever before. </p>
                    <p>Challenges that I faced while doing so were numerous, as I did not know how to use flexboxes or
                        CSS while building a website. </p>
                    <p>However, through looking through HTML and CSS tutorials found online, I've gained a much better
                        understanding of how CSS and Javascript can be used to make websites. </p>
                    <p>This website uses the catpuccin color scheme and supports mobile layout, as well as dark and
                        light mode. </p>
